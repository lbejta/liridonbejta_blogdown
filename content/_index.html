<p>I see myself as a business developer who uses advanced techniques to solve problems rather than a data scientist. The process of turning raw data into insights, and communicating those insights in order to inspire people to make data-driven decisions is what interests me the most. Being able to translate real world problems into a problem which can be solved with data, and communicating those results back to the business is what I’m trying to get better at every single day.</p>
<p>Learning new things keeps me going. Therefore, I dedicated this blog to show you the things I learned, created, or stumpled upon. I will try to post every now and then. All of my creations can be found in the <strong>Projects</strong> map.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I love to read (mostly non-fiction) books (hit me up for any good suggestions!). I always carry a book when I’m on the road. Other things that interests me are sports and nutrition and behavioral economics.</p>
